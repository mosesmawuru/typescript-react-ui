# Getting Started

Blockstack UI is a component library built for use with React. It uses [styled-components](https://styled-components.com)
and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com) under the hood for a CSS-in-JS solution for building complex, accessible UI components.

## Installation

> Note: we use `yarn`, but you can also use `npm`

First, make sure to install `styled-components` and its babel plugin:

```
yarn add styled-components babel-plugin-styled-components
```

Then, install `@blockstack/ui`:

```
yarn add @blockstack/ui
```

### With next.js

If you're using `@blockstack/ui` with next.js, make sure to check out the
[styled-components example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-styled-components) to correctly
use styled-components in a SSR environment.

## Usage

> Please note that you will need to have the [styled-components babel plugin](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components)
> set up in your project in order to use the `css` prop.

To use any component from `@blockstack/ui`, we need to import the `ThemeProvider` into the root component of the app that
will be using Blockstack UI. The ThemeProvider creates a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) scope
for all of our components to use.

```jsx live=false
// app.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@blockstack/ui';

<ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
```

### Reset global styles

Typically you will want to apply a css reset to your page. `@blockstack/ui` exports
a [`CSSReset`](/components/css-reset) that will reset and improve the browsers default styles. It's heavily inspired by
[Tailwind's preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@1.1.2/dist/base.css).

```jsx live=false
const App({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <CSSReset />
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Using components

Simply import components by name from the `@blockstack/ui` package, as shown
below.

```js
import { Button } from '@blockstack/ui';
```
