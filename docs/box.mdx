# Box

99% of the components in this design system are built with one of three elements: `Box`, `Flex`, or `Inline`. All three of them share the same prop-types, but the difference is their underlying dom element. Please use these components when building custom components in your project. Avoid using `div` and `spans` wherever possible.

```jsx
import { Box } from 'blockstack-ui'
```
This is our base primitive. It can consume all of the props exposed by `styled-system`.
