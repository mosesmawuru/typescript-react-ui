# System Props

System Props come from the package [`styled-system`](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) by @jxnblk. It is described as:
> Responsive, theme-based style props for building design systems with React

With `styled-system` groups of props are applied to each component in the Blockstack Design System. These props map directly to most css properties and allow you to write css without ever writing css!

`styled-system` categorizes props into these groups:

- [Core](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md#core)
- [Typography](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md#typography)
- [Layout](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md#layout)
- [Misc](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md#misc)
- [Position](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md#position)

All of the components can use any of the `styled-system` prop functions listed above, but check each components documentation to see the recommended usage.
