# The System

The components in this design system are first and foremost primitives. What are primitives?

From `react-primitives`: 
> This library attempts to propose an ideal set of primitives around building React applications, regardless of Platform. In the future, this could be used as a shared interface among React and React Native components that don't use platform-specific APIs.


## Principles of The System

- The components are almost all primitives
- Always ask the question `how can this be better?`
- Very little design direction (just enough)
- Share common patterns
- Explore multiple solutions / ideas when designing
- If we explore something and it turns out, in that specific context, to be better than The System, do that thing vs using something premade in this system
- Be Consistent
- Be Flexible
- Do not prescribe
- Adapt and Improve

## When to use The System
- When building any UI 

## Things to avoid

Statements like
> because that is how the system works

Do not burn time/cycles worrying about The System when we have real products and real customer needs to focus on
